description: <a href=“http://t2c2.csl.illinois.edu”>T2C2</a>, shortened from the Timely and Trustworthy Curating and Coordinating Data Framework is a project that aims to dramatically reduce the materials-to-device process, which currently can last up to 20 years. One of T2C2's goals is to develop a new framework and system that focuses on curating, correlating and coordinating materials-to-devices data in real time before fully archiving and publishing the data for widespread access. This program is through the Coordinated Science Lab at the Univerisity of Illinois.
