description: The <a href="https://materialsdatafacility.org/">Materials Data Facility</a> (MDF) is set of data services built specifically to support materials science researchers. MDF consists of two synergistic services, data publication and data discovery (in development). The production-ready data publication service offers a scalable repository where materials scientists can publish, preserve, and share research data. The repository provides a focal point for the materials community, enabling publication and discovery of materials data of all sizes. (i literally just copied & pasted this from the site, idk if this even needs to be here or if it will stay here, if i need to site it at all)
